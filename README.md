C128 Core for Mega65
====================

This port is using the c128 core from MiSTer and uses the MiSTer2MEGA65 framework to port it to the MEGA65.
MiSTer2MEGA65 is a framework to simplify porting MiSTer cores to the MEGA65.

This core is not yet fully functional. Please see the [Project Blog](https://wiki.eilers-online.net/c128Mega65) to get more information about the current status.
